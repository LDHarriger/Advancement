% Sleep is a great model to study interactions between brain systems because the activities of both neurons and glia change so markedly between these two states. Furthermore, sleep dysfunction is a risk factor for many diseases, especially of the brain. 
% I hope to identify mechanisms of interaction between systems supporting brain function by developing approaches that enhance existing imaging techniques through the integration of multiple data modalities.
% Longterm, homeostatic importance of sleep, and interaction of various systems to support the brain.
% I think the neuroscience of sleep is intimately related to the work of non-neuronal cells forming a robust infrastructure that supports the strenuous activity and intricate, but fragile structure of the nervous system.

\section*{Sleep staging}
Sleep stages were defined by Allan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales in 1968 based on a method of evaluating polysomnography (PSG) comprised of three types of recordings: (1) electroencephalogram (EEG) derived from at least two electrodes placed near the center of the scalp to measure brain activity, (2) electrooculogram (EOG) ideally placed above and below the eyes to measure eye movements, (3) electromusculogram (EMG) ideally placed on and beneath the chin to measure general muscle tone \cite{Kales1968}. These three signals are then visually evaluated to stage sleep in 30 second epochs roughly according to the descriptions below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[] Stage 1: Non-REM stage 1, abbreviated as NREM1, is a transitory stage of sleep onset and might be characterized as a drowsy restfulness. During this period eye movement slows and muscle tone begins to decrease. Also during this stage, the 8-12Hz alpha rhythm usually present when an awake subject closes their eyes begins to disappear; however, brief bursts of a slightly higher frequency around 12-16Hz, but with lower voltage, called spindles, may be evident.
\item[] Stages 2-4: NREM2-4 are increasing depths of sleep. Starting with NREM2, the most prominent feature of sleep, the slow wave (SW), begins to emerge and persist through NREM4, which is why these three stages are collectively referred to as slow wave sleep (SWS). The incidence of SWs per 30 sec epoch defines the depth of sleep with thresholds of $<$20\%, 20-50\%, $>$50\% defining NREM2-4, respectively. Additionally, during NREM2 and 3, spindles may be present.
\item[] Stage 5: Rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, has also been called paradoxical sleep because it significantly deviates from the EEG patterns observed during NREM, and rather appears with low-voltage mixed-frequency signals very similar to a waking EEG. However, this paradoxical activity can be distinguished with the rest of the PSG since muscle tone remains low, but eye movement becomes rapid.
%\item[] Stage 6: Wake, finally, is distinguished with a high muscle tone, moderate eye movement, and a low-voltage mixed frequency signal, possibly including alpha oscillations.
\end{enumerate}
In addition to these five stages, are criteria for marking epochs during wake, movements, or obscured by too many artifacts to properly score.

%% Should I keep ???
% These scoring criteria (with some slight modifications for other animals), have provided the standard framework to further study sleep. For instance, these are the stages used by clinicians to diagnose sleep disorders, and to study sleep induced biochemical changes. Likewise, this system has been a powerful influence on our understanding of sleep. While this standardization provides a common language for sleep necessary for building knowledge in this domain, it also creates a certain rigidity. The scoring criteria has remained essentially unchanged until 2007, when the AASM consolidated NREM3 and NREM4 into NREM3. While useful, a rigid framework may also impose artificial constraints scientific questions.

These waveforms can be found in nearly all brain regions, however, the cortex is the main source of this activity.

SW are related to up/down pan-neuronal activation states \cite{Steriade2001}.

\subsection*{Locality}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Sleep has long been conceptualized as a global brain state, and likewise the signals were believed to be global as well. This idea was probably influenced by sparse EEG coverage since R\&K scoring can be done sufficiently with a single referenced channel. Finally, in 2011, this perspective shifted with one of the first intracranial EEG (iEEG) sleep studies in humans which showed that SWs and spindles tended to be much more local events \cite{Nir2011}.

\subsubsection*{Conceptual foundations}
Brain Electrophysiology Excitation Inhibition Turing pattern

The body is composed of many cells of various types communicating with others at various distances and timescales. Most cells communicate by releasing signaling molecules. These signals can be passed almost immediately to a cell’s direct neighbors if there are gap junctions linking the cells; otherwise, the signal must diffuse through the extra-cellular space to reach its destination. A random walk through the tightly packed extracellular space means that the probability of a signal reaching a particular cell within some period of time falls off very quickly with distance. This problem is mitigated by the many vessels in the body providing less hindered directed channels of flow, and often propulsion to increase the speed. Although the neuron is subject to the same constraints, but it is exceptional in its ability to communicate quickly and at long distances because of a few remarkable adaptations. First, neurons leverage fast ionic conductivity by manipulating electrostatic and concentration gradients with dynamically tuned micro-fluidics. Second, some neurons have highly elongated processes which can grow to very long distances. These are far from the only remarkable features of neurons, but together, these adaptations effectively allow neurons to communicate with very distant cells as if they were next-door neighbors. While the evolutionary importance of features can hardly be overstated, the majority of neurons communicate over relatively short distances.

This ionic conduction also enables scientists to monitor the activity of neuron with electrophysiology. Population activity 
Perhaps the distinction between local and global is a bit misguided. 

These neurons can be quickly and precisely altered by various ion channel proteins in the membrane .

The brain is a physical system basically composed of cells that can integrate many inputs, and over some threshold, project signals as input to other cells. However, inputs can vary widely in function, some on short timescales by raising or lowering the cells membrane potential, or others in some way re-tuning the cell - e.g. RNA transcription. Furthermore, these neurons can be arranged to create circuits, which are organized together perform complex computations.

With extracellular electrophysiology, even for micro-electrodes capable of single unit recordings, it is difficult to determine the type of input or output. 
 of groups of neurons synchronizes to form oscillatory rhythms. 

So, unless there is another source of the EEG signal besides neuronal activity, a global SW would entail that many widely distributed neurons are simultaneously activated and deactivated. Probably the easiest way to coordinate this would be for a single generator to send a signal to every area; however, conduction speed would lead to imprecise delivery times, unless this generator were located precisely the same distance from each region or somehow tuned to compensate for conduction.

In contrast, a perfectly local signal would be one that is isolated to a single area, and not spread to other areas. In a less strict interpretation, a local signal might be one that occurs in one location, but could be sent to another location. This is unlikely because nearby areas are more highly connected.

So it is much more likely that there is a spread of activity into surrounding areas in addition to saltatory transmissions of activity to more remote areas, which in turn spread locally.
The brain has very neurotransmitters, some with very exotic downstream effects, but on short-timescales most of them impart a transient change in ionic permeability increasing (excitatory) or decreases (inhibitory) voltage, and likewise firing probability. Furthermore, the connectivity of the neurons imparts a structure over which the excitatory and inhibitory signals can propagate. The dynamics of this system have been characterized as a reaction-diffusion system, which was famously introduced and analyzed by Alan Turing. One of the most interesting features, of such systems are their extensive repertoire of spatiotemporal dynamics. Even simple systems can be tuned to reproduce patterns like leopard spots, and over time these patterns evolve as traveling waves of patterns. [Cite:The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis - Turing, 1952]

Perhaps particular waveforms are emerge out of reaction diffusion stability. The detection of travelling waves could be used to infer effective connectivity. If this is the case, mapping the spatiotemporal repertoire of these waveforms may suggest its principal source and sinks, functional/computational role, facilitate a predictive model, etc. [Cite: Intracting Turing-Hopf instabilities Steyn-Ross]

\subsection*{Sleep and aging}
Time spent awake, increases homeostatic sleep pressure, and if sleep deprivation is sufficiently prolonged, it can result in cognitive lapses which are accompanied by SW activity (Nir, 2017). SWs up/down states. Furthermore, these periods are correlated with lapses in performance on cognitive tasks, and this was shown in both rats and humans. 

\subsection*{Amyloid-$\beta$ and Tau}
Both amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) and tau are proteins associated with normal brain activity. Amyloid-$\beta$ is formed when amyloid precursor protein (APP) is embedded in a cell's membrane and subsequently cleaved by $\beta$- and $\gamma$- secretases. Although the native role of APP has remained elusive, it is found in various cells of the body, and is particularly concentrated in the synapses of neurons. Amyloid-$\beta$ accumulates with time spent awake, and the 

Tau is   which accumulates with time spent awake and begins to form plaques. 
Tau phosphorylation increases with time spent awake. Eventually phosphorylated proteins form aggregates called tangles.
The concentration of amyloid-$\beta$ increases with time spent awake.

[Horseradish peroxidase by Patricia Grady suggested fluid circulation in subarachnoid space (Rennels, 1990). ] Work by Nedergaard and Illiff, broadened our view of the blood brain barrier by showing that the perivascular (Virchow-Robbins) space, formed by the endfeet of astrocytes, mediate the flow of csf into the interstitial fluid of the brain, and termed this the glymphatic system. This process functions to deliver nutrients to cells throughout the brain, as well as clear toxins and metabolic waste from brain parenchyma to the ventricular and venous systems so it may ultimately be cleared from the body - this was termed the glymphatic system. Later Antoine Louveau and Jonathan Kipnis showed evidence of a more traditional lymphatic vessel incorporated in the brain’s dura, which has been termed cerebral lymphatic vessels.
